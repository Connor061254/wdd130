        <h2> Picking your guitar! </h2>
        <p>
Choosing the right guitar is a personal journey. Whether you're drawn to the warm tones of an acoustic, the versatility of an electric, or the rich sounds of a classical guitar, it's important to find an instrument that resonates with you. 
        </p>

        <p>
When selecting your guitar, consider factors such as body style, neck profile, and string type. Visit local music stores to try out different models and seek advice from experienced players or instructors. Remember, the best guitar for you is the one that feels comfortable and inspires you to play.
        </p>

        <p>
            Important Things to consider when purchasing your first guitar: The Acoustic guitar is often what youll see the most and what beginners usually start off with. It often has a longer and thinner neck, and steel strings which are harder to press down but give a brighter sound. The Classical guitar gives a softer and mellower sound due to its nylon strings, which are easier on the fingers for beginners. However, it typically has a shorter and wider neck, which can be difficult for some to play chords on, especially for those with smaller hands. The Electric guitar is another popular choice, especially for those interested in rock, blues, or jazz. It requires an amplifier to produce a nice sound and usually has a thinner neck and softer strings, making it easier to play fast solos and complex chords. However, it can be more expensive due to the need for additional equipment like amps and cables.

        <h2>Strumming Style</h2>
        <p>Strumming involves brushing across multiple strings at once to play chords. This technique is the rhythmic backbone of countless songs, especially in pop, rock, and folk music. Most beginners start here, often using a pick (or plectrum) to get a bright, clear sound, though you can also use your fingers. It's perfect for accompanying your voice or playing along with your favorite tracks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <h2>Fingerstyle</h2>
        <p>Fingerstyle, or fingerpicking, is a more complex technique where you use your thumb and individual fingers to pluck specific strings. This allows you to play multiple parts at the same time like a bass line with your thumb and a melody with your fingers. It's common in classical, folk, and blues music. While it can be more challenging to coordinate at first, it opens up a beautiful and complex world of acoustic playing.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started with Strumming</h2>
        <div class="image-placeholder">

            <img src="images/strum.png" alt="Strumming Illustration">
            
        </div>
        <p>Your first step is to get comfortable holding a pick. A common way is to make a loose fist, then place the pick on the side of your index finger, holding it in place with your thumb. Only a small tip of the pick should be showing.</p>
        <p>Once you're comfortable, practice a basic down-up motion with a relaxed wrist. A great first pattern is **Down - Down - Up - Up - Down - Up**. Try doing this pattern With a G, C, and D chord progression. Use the Image Below as a reference. </p>
        
        <h3>How to Read a Chord Diagram</h3>
        <p>A chord diagram is a map of the guitar's fretboard. Here's how to read it:</p>
        <div class="diagram-image">

            <img src="images/G_C_D.png" alt="Guitar Chord Diagram">
            

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The **6 vertical lines** are the guitar strings. The one on the far left is the thickest (low E), and the one on the far right is the thinnest (high E).</li>
            <li>The **horizontal lines** are the frets. The space between the top line (the nut) and the first horizontal line is the 1st fret.</li>
            <li>**Dots (●)** show you where to place your fingers.</li>
            <li>An **"O"** above a string means to play that string "open" (with no fingers on it).</li>
            <li>An **"X"** above a string means to "mute" that string; don't play it at all.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

    <section class="guide-card">
        <h2>Getting Started with Fingerstyle</h2>
        <div class="image-placeholder">

            <img src="images/PIMA.jpg" alt="Fingerstyle Illustration">
            
        </div>
        <p>Fingerstyle starts with your hand position. In classical and fingerstyle, we label our picking fingers **P-I-M-A**:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**P** = Thumb (Pulgar) - Plays the 3 bass strings (E, A, D)</li>
            <li>**I** = Index (Indice) - Plays the G string</li>
            <li>**M** = Middle (Medio) - Plays the B string</li>
            <li>**A** = Ring (Anular) - Plays the high E string</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A great first exercise is to pluck them one by one: **P, then I, then M, then A**.</p>

        <h3>How to Read Guitar Tabs</h3>
        <p>Guitar Tablature (or "tabs") is a simple way to read music. It shows you what strings to play and what frets to press.</p>
        <div class="diagram-image">
            <img src="images/Guitar_tab.png" alt="Guitar Tablature Example">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The **6 horizontal lines** represent the 6 strings of the guitar. Unlike chord diagrams, the **top line is the thinnest string** (high E) and the bottom line is the thickest (low E).</li>
            <li>**Numbers** on the lines tell you which fret to press down. A **"0"** means to play that string open.</li>
            <li>You read tabs from **left to right**, just like a book.</li>
        </ul>
        </section>

    <h2>A Personal Recommendation</h2>
    <p>So, you've picked a style (or maybe both!) and have tried out the basics. You might be wondering, "What's next?" or "How do I stay motivated and stick with practicing?"</p>
    
    <h3>If you're drawn to strumming:</h3>
    <p>A fantastic next step is to find beginner-level songs you love on YouTube. Look up the chord diagrams and the strumming pattern, and dedicate your practice time to mastering that one song. Getting through your first full song is a huge confidence booster!</p>
    
    <h3>If you're exploring fingerstyle:</h3>
    <p>You can absolutely find tabs for simple songs and learn them. However, here's another method I highly recommend:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by playing simple melodies (like "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star") on just <strong>one string</strong>. Get comfortable moving your fretting hand up and down the neck.</li>
        <li>Once you're confident, try playing melodies that use <strong>two strings</strong>.</li>
        <li>Gradually add more strings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This "one-string-at-a-time" approach is a great way to build dexterity and learn the fretboard without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
