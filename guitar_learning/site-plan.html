        <strong>Our Philosophy: Fun First!</strong>
        <br>Why do people quit guitar? They get buried in boring theory and drills. "Don't Fret" is all about fun first. We get you playing something that sounds like music today. That "Hey, I'm doing it!" feeling is what brings you back tomorrow. People come here to play, so let's get you playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What You'll Find Here</strong>
        <br>Beginners are thinking: "Where do I start?" "How do I strum?" "My fingers hurt!" We answer that. Just a clear Start Here, simple chord diagrams, and easy songs. The goal? Get you playing G, C, and D with a basic strum or fingerpicking pattern. That one skill unlocks thousands of songs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Choosing Your First Guitar</strong>
        <br>Buying a guitar is a huge, roadblock. We'll give you a simple, no-BS guide. No brand loyalties, just honest pros and cons. "Want to play rock? Look at this." "Want to sing? Look at this." We help you find a decent, budget-friendly guitar that's easy to play.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Your First Chords: The Building Blocks</strong>
        <br>The magic starts here. You don't need 100 chords. You need three: G, C, D. We show you exactly where to put your fingers. It's going to sound bad at first, and switching will be slow. That's normal! Don't worry, everyone sounds like this! We'll focus on exercises to get those switches smooth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>When to Start Music Theory (Beginner's Edition)</strong>
        <br>This section is tiny on purpose. Our philosophy is: No theory yet! Just go back and play. The time for theory is when you start asking why things work. When you get curious about why G, C, and D sound good together, you'll be ready for the Intermediate page.

      <h3>Intermediate</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Welcome to the Next Level</strong>
        <br>This is for the player who feels lost. You know your open chords, but you feel... stuck. You're bored and still feel like a beginner. This section is all about breaking out of that beginner's box and turning you from a strummer into a real guitar player.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Introducing Scales: The Pentatonic</strong>
        <br>What's the first thing intermediate players want to do? Solo. The answer is the Minor Pentatonic scale. We won't just show you a box pattern. We'll show you why it's cool with great backing tracks. The goal isn't just to memorize. It's to play your first real solo, right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Learning new techniques and barre chords</strong>
        <br>Barre chords. This is where people quit. That first time you do a barre chord will feel impossible, but don't worry, everyone struggles with barre chords. We will show you techniques and practices you can do to help you perform barre chords with ease. We will also introduce you to other techniques like pulloffs, hammer-ons, tapping, harmonics, and slides! I know it sounds like a lot but trust me these techniques are so fun to learn and will make your guitar sound amazing.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Intermediate Music Theory: The "Why"</strong>
        <br>You've been playing, you're curious, and you've hit a wall. Now it's time for theory. We'll finally connect the dots. We'll answer: "What is a 'key'?" "What's a 'I-IV-V' progression?" and "How do I read the fretboard?". We'll introduce the Major Scale and show how all your chords are built from it. This is where the lightbulb goes on.

      <h3>Advanced</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Beyond the Basics: Mastering Your Instrument</strong>
        <br>This is for the comfortable player who's ready for mastery. You're playing songs and kind of understanding why it works. You're asking the big questions about the fretboard, modes, and finding your own voice. This section is less "what to play" and more "understand the concept."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Unlocking the Fretboard: The CAGED System</strong>
        <br>The CAGED system is the secret to finally understanding the fretboard. We'll show how those five simple open chords (C, A, G, E, D) are just moveable shapes. They connect to form a map of the entire neck, unifying scales, arpeggios, and chords.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advanced Theory: Modes and Harmony</strong>
        <br>Time for the deep end. We teach modes as flavors, not just scales. "Want that Santana sound? That's Dorian." We focus on the sound and application. Then, harmony making your chords juicy with 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths to get that pro R&B or jazz sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Specialized Techniques</strong>
        <br>This is the choose your own adventure section. What's your goal? Metal shredder? Check out sweep picking. Percussive-acoustic? Here's our fingerstyle module. We'll have lessons on hybrid picking, slide, and more. This is what takes you from "good" to "great" in the style you love.
